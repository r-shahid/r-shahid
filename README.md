### Hi, I'm Riana

I'm a NYC-based web developer who is always ready for a challenge. I graduated from New York University with a BA in Mathematics in 2019. Since then, I studied code on my own and at General Assembly, where I'm currently working as a Teaching Assistant. In my free time you can find me working on projects to develop my skills in old and new technologies.

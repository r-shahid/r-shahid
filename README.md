### Hi, I'm Riana

I'm a NYC-based web developer who is always ready for a challenge. I graduated from New York University with a BA in Mathematics. Since then, I studied code on my own and at General Assembly, where I later worked as a Teaching Assistant. Currently, I'm working as an Implementation Developer at AudioEye. In my free time you can find me working on projects to develop my skills in old and new technologies.
